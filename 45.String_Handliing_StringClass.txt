String Class
------------
it is a immutable class.
immutable means non modifiable.
it means object of immutable classes can not be modified.
So String stored in String class object can not be changed.It means this object is constant.

StringBuffer class and StringBuilder class is mutable.

StringBuffer class is synchronized while StringBuilder class is non-synchronized.


if a class is synchronised then at a single time only one thread can use this class.while if a class is non synchronised then at a single time more than one thread can use this class.


Remember  object of String class is created automatically for each String.So we do not need to write code to create object of String class.

//we do not need to write code to create String class object if we want we can write.

		String str1="Cetpa"
		StringBuffer str2=new StringBuffer("Infotech");
		StringBuilder str3=new StringBuilder("Noida");
		
		System.out.println(str1);
		System.out.println(str2);
		System.out.println(str3);


String constant pool
--------------------
As we know Object of String class is created automatically for each String. JVM creates this object in String constant pool area in memory.

other objects are created in heap area.

Note:for Same String only one object of string class is created.

String str1="Cetpa";
//object of String class will be created for value cetpa and refrnece of the object is returned.variable str1 will hold that objetc's refrence.

String str1="Cetpa";
//for this value object has already been created,so new object will not be created for this cetpa .Refrence of old object will returned and  variable str2 will hold this refrence.


proof that same string contains the same refrnce of the same object

public class App 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		String str1="CEtpa";
		String str2="CEtpa";
		
		boolean res=str1==str2;
		System.out.println(res);
	}
}
output
------
true


here the object of string class is created in heap area of memory hence saving the different refrnece.

public class App 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		
		//this object is cretaed in String constant pool area in memory and is created automatically.
		String str1="CEtpa";
		String str2="CEtpa";
		
		boolean res=str1==str2;
		System.out.println(res);

		//this object of string class is created in heap memory
		String str3=new String("Cetpa");
		String str4=new String("Cetpa");
		res=str3==str4;
		System.out.println(res);
	}
}

output
------
true
false
