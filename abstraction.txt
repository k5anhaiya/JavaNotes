Abstraction
-----------
Hiding non-essential details of an object/entity from the user is known as abstraction.

public void ShowArea()      //defining a method.
{
	code          //-->here we are implenting our method.
	{

	}
}

Hiding implementation/body of a method is known as abstraction in programming.
This is achieved by defining abstract methods.

syntax
------
public abstract void show();

abstract modifier is used to define abstract methods.

Abstract method
---------------
Those methods which do not have body or implementation are known as abstract methods.

Abstract methods can only be defined inside abstract class or inside interface.



Abstract class 
---------------
A class which can not be intantiated(creation of object) is known as abstract class.
It means object from abstract class can not be created.

Abstract class should be defined in following two situations 
1)object of the class can not be created.

public abstract class Shape 
{

}

public class App 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		new shape();      //this will show error because object can not be created.
	}

}

2)we want to define abstract method inside the class. 

public class Shape 
{
	public abstract void ShowArea();  //it will show error because abstarct methods can                                            //only be defined under abstract class.
}

it should be like this:

public abstract class Shape 
{
	public abstract void ShowArea();  //this will not show error.
}


Abstract class is used as parent.

Need:you want to define three classes
1) Circle class:it must have method to find and show area of circle.
2) Rectange class:it must have method to find and show area of reactangle.
3) Triangle class:it must have method to find and show area of triangle.

these classes are related,because these are shapes.these classes should be defined in hierarchical manner.

those classes those are in hierarchichal manner have following advantage:
1)using these classes in application is easy.
2)it increases efficiency of the application.
3)it reduces the complexity of code.
4)single reference varibale can be created to used to store refrence of these classes object.

common properties(mostly methods) of these classes are defined in parent class.

if common method of these classes has different implementation in each class then this method should be abstract in parent class.

below written code are not in hierarchichal method
--------------------------------------------------

public class Circle 
{
	private int radius;
	public Circle(int radius)
	{
		this.radius=radius;
	}
	public void findCircleArea()
	{
		double area=3.14*radius*radius;
		System.out.println("Area of Circle="+area);
	}

}

public class Rectangle 
{
	private int length;
	private int breadth;
	public Rectangle(int length,int breadth)
	{
		this.length=length;
		this.breadth=breadth;
	}
	public void findRectangleArea()
	{
		int area=length*breadth;
		System.out.println("Area of Rectangle="+area);
	}

}


public class Triangle 
{
	private int base;
	private int height;
	public Triangle(int base,int height)
	{
		this.base=base;
		this.height=height;
	}
	public void findTrianlgeArea()
	{
		double area=0.5*base*height;
		System.out.println("Area of Traingle="+area);
	}

}

import java.util.Scanner;

public class App 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		Circle  c1;
		Rectangle r1;
		Triangle t1;
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter 1 for Circle");
		System.out.println("Enter 2 for Rectangle");
		System.out.println("Enter 3 for Triangle");
		System.out.println("---------------------------");
		System.out.println("Enter your choice");
		int ch=sc.nextInt();
		if(ch==1)
		{
			System.out.println("Enter radius=");
			int r=sc.nextInt();
			c1=new Circle(r);
			c1.findCircleArea();
		}
		if(ch==2)
		{
			System.out.println("Enter length=");
			int l=sc.nextInt();
			System.out.println("Enter breadth=");
			int b=sc.nextInt();
			r1=new Rectangle(l,b);
			r1.findRectangleArea();;
		}
		if(ch==3)
		{
			System.out.println("Enter base=");
			int b=sc.nextInt();
			System.out.println("Enter height=");
			int h=sc.nextInt();
			t1=new Triangle(b,h);
			t1.findTrianlgeArea();
		}
	}

}

Note: All abstract methods of parent class must be overriden by child classes.

above code  should allowed in this manner

//this Shape class would be parent of all classes such as circle,rectangle,triangle

public abstract class Shape 
{
	//this method is abstract here because implementation of this method would be different 
	//in each shape.
	public abstract void findShapeArea();
}


public class Circle extends Shape
{
	private int radius;
	public Circle(int radius)
	{
		this.radius=radius;
	}
	public void findShapeArea()
	{
		double area=3.14*radius*radius;
		System.out.println("Area of Circle="+area);
	}

}

public class Rectangle extends Shape 
{
	private int length;
	private int breadth;
	public Rectangle(int length,int breadth)
	{
		this.length=length;
		this.breadth=breadth;
	}
	public void findShapeArea()
	{
		int area=length*breadth;
		System.out.println("Area of Rectangle="+area);
	}

}


public class Triangle extends Shape
{
	private int base;
	private int height;
	public Triangle(int base,int height)
	{
		this.base=base;
		this.height=height;
	}
	public void findShapeArea()
	{
		double area=0.5*base*height;
		System.out.println("Area of Traingle="+area);
	}

}

import java.util.Scanner;

public class App 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		Shape sh=null;
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

when method should be abstracted.
when method exists in each child and implementation of the method is different in each child then this method should be abstract in parent class.

point1: Abstract class can be defined without defining abstract methods inside class
point2: Abstract method can not be defined without defining abstract class
point3: Abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
