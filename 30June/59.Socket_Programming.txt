Scoket programming
------------------
it is used to communicate between two programmes.
socket programming should be done when you want to build client and server application.

client application sends request to the server application
server application provides response to the client application
communication between client and server application will be done using two sockets.
one socket will be created by client programme at client side.
server programme will create a socket for this client at server side.

Both client and server programme will use these sockets for communication.

Every socket will be represented in the form of object.This object is created from java.net.Socket class(i.e socket class)

client programme must create an object of this class to make connection with server.

code to create socket will be written as
-----------------------------------------
Inside constructor of this class we need to pass ip address of the server programme and port number of the server programme.
Socket soc=new Socket(" 192.168.0.105",8080);

 192.168.0.105 :this is ip address of the server programme.
 8080		:this is port number of ther server programme.

Remember ip address is used to identify on which server or client programme is running.
Port number is used to identify server or client programme.

Creating server programme
-------------------------

import java.net.*;
public class Myserver
{
	private ServerSocket server;  //here ServerSocket is the cass & server is refrence variable.
	public Myserver()
	{
		try
		{
			//code to create server
			server=new ServerSocket(2001);//2001 will be port number of this server
						//this code will create server and start server also
			System.out.println("Server Started....");
			while(true)
			{
				//code to accept client connection request
				server.accept();//This method will be called when client will send request(client programme will create socket)
				System.out.println("Client connected..");
			}
		}
		catch(Exception ex)
		{
			System.out.println(ex);
		}
	}
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		new MyServer();
	}
}



Creating client programme
-------------------------

import java.net.*;

public class MyClient 
{
	private Socket soc; //here Socket is the class & soc is refrence variable.
	
	public MyClient()
	{
		try 
		{
			//code to create server
			soc=new Socket("local host",2001);//because server is running on the same computer
			
		} 
		catch (Exception e) 
		{
			System.out.println(e);
		}
		
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		new MyClient();

	}

}


Note: if port number and ip address is wrong then it will not show server connected.
