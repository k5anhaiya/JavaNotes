String Handling
---------------
Set of Character is known as String.

'a','8','*' these are characters and combining all these we will get String.

"Rehan Ahmad" is a String this String consists of  10 character's.
"9572431005" is a String.
"5kanhaiyakumar@gmail.com" is a String.

Programme must create char type array to store String.
In Java we do not need to write code to create this array.
In Java this code is predefined.
Following three class have this code
1)String class
2)StringBuffer class
3)StringBuilder class

So rathe than writing code to create array, we need to write code to create object of one of the above class.

String str1=new String("Cetpa");
StringBuffer str2=new StringBuffer("Infotech");
StringBuilder str3=new StringBuilder("Noida");

All above objects will create char type array to keep String.



important: Here cetpa is stored in a char type array this array refrence  is stored in object of string class and refrence of that object of string class is stored in str1.


with the help of toString method it is calling the array elements automatically.
