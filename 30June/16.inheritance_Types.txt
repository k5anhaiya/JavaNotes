inheritance need
-----------------
1)i want to create extension of the existing class. -->Multilevel inheritance
2)i want to define mutltiple classes and these classes have several common properties.   --->hybrid inheritance

Types of inheritance
----------------------
1)single level inheritance
2)multi level inheritance
3)hierarchical inheritance
4)Multiple inheritance
5)Hydrid inheritance

single level inheritance
------------------------ 
parent class has only one child and no parent.
child class has only one parent  and no child.

public class AA
{
}
public class BB extends AA
{
}

multi level inheritance--------> it should be in hirerachal manner.
-----------------------
public class AA
{
}
public class BB extends AA
{
}
public class CC extends BB
{
}
public class DD extends CC
{
}

hierarchical inheritance
-------------------------
public class AA
{
}
public class BB extends AA
{
}
public class CC extends AA
{
}
public class DD extends AA
{
}

Multiple inheritance
---------------------
having more than one parent.
in java it is not possible in classes but it is possible in interfaces.
child class can not have more than one parent class.
child interface can have more than one parent interface.

public class AA
{
}
public class BB
{
}
public class CC extends AA,BB     //this will give an error because multiple //parent in classes is not posssible as discussed
{
}

                 but in interface it is possible
		 -------------------------------
public interface AA
{}
public interface BB
{}
public interface CC extends AA,BB   //muliple parents interface is allowed.
{}

Hydrid inheritance
------------------
having more than one parent interface and more than one child interface
in java it is not possible in classes but it is possible in interfaces.

public interface AA
{}
public interface BB
{}
public interface CC extends AA,BB   //muliple parents interface is allowed.
{}
public interface DD extends CC
{}
public interface EE extends DD
{}
