Method overriding
-----------------
Redifining parent class methods into child class is known as method overriding.

Rules of Method over riding:
----------------------------
1)Parameter list of the method should be same.
2)Return type of method must be same.
3)child class method should not be less accessible/visible than the parent class method.

public class AA
{
	public void greet()
	{
	System.out.println("Hello");
	}
}
public class BB extends AA
{
	public void greet()
	{
	System.out.println("Namaste");
	}
}
public class CC extends AA
{
	public void greet()
	{
	System.out.println("sasriakal");
	}
}
public class DD extends AA
{
	public void greet()
	{
	System.out.println("Asalam valekum");
	}
}

main
-----
public class App 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		//AA obj=new BB();  //here refrence of AA is taken because it is parent class
		                  //here object of BB is creating.
		//obj.greet();     //calling the method of BB

		//AA obj=new CC();  //here refrence of AA is taken because it is parent class
        					//here object of CC is creating.
		//obj.greet();     //calling the method of CC

		AA obj=new DD();  //here refrence of AA is taken because it is parent class
        					//here object of DD is creating.
		obj.greet();     //calling the method of DD
	}

}

method overriding taking place again and again according to requirement.


Example:
Q-WAP to find the sum of three numbers third number should be added using method over riding.
A-
public class Addition
{
	private int num1,num2;
	public Addition(int num1,int num2)  // this is constructor 
	{
		this.num1=num1;
		this.num2=num2;
	}
	public int sum()
	{
	int sum=num1+num2;
	return sum;
	}
}

here we are getting the sum of two numbers while we create the object and call sum();
but we need to add the sum of three numbers.

hence we will make a new child class.

public class AdditionPlus extends Addition
{
	private int num3;
	public AdditonPlus(int num1,num2,num3)  //we need to define the constructor again for 
                                                 //for three parameters
	{
		super(num1,num2);
		this.num3=num3;
	}
	public int sum()          //we are again over riding the method
	{
		int res=super.sum();
		res+=num3;
		return res;
	}
}

now the code is complete we need to make the main method.
main
----

public class App 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		/*Addition obj=new Addition(10,20);
		int res=obj.sum();
		System.out.println("Sum="+res);*/
		/*Addition obj=new AdditionPlus(10,20,30);*/  //we can take refrence variable of
		                                              // the parent class also.
		AdditionPlus obj=new AdditionPlus(10,20,30);
		int res=obj.sum();
		System.out.println("Sum="+res);
	}

}
this will add all three numbers.
