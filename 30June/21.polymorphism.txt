Polymorphism
------------
it is a greek word. polymorphism means having many forms. or one name many forms.
it reduces the complexity of the code.

polymorphism is achieved by the help of method overloading and method over riding.

types of polymorphism
----------------------
1)Static polymorphism:
it is achieved by method overloading(defining more than one same name method inside the same class). this also known as compile time polymorphism.

2)dynamic polymorphism
it is achieved by method over riding(redifining same name method in child class ,which is already defined in parent class). this is also known as run time polymorphism.


public class LargestNumber 
{
	public void sum(int x, int y,int z)
	{
	int res= x+y+z;
	System.out.println("sum="+res);
	}
	public void sum(int x, int y)
	{
	int res= x+y;
	System.out.println("sum="+res);
	}
	public void sum(float x,float y,float z)
	{
	float res= x+y+z;
	System.out.println("sum="+res);
	}
	public void sum(float x, float y)
	{
	float res= x+y;
	System.out.println("sum="+res);
	}

}


main
----
public class App 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		LargestNumber obj=new LargestNumber();
		obj.sum(10,20);
		obj.sum(25,15,63);
		obj.sum(12,45);
		obj.sum(15,56,896);
	}
}
