IO(Input and output)
--------------------
Input is read operation. Program can read data from the source such as file,input buffer,socket etc.

Output is write operation. programme can write data to destination such as file,output buffer, socket etc.

programme performs read and write opeerations with the help of stream.In Java every stream is represented in the form of object.

we need to write code to create these stream.code can be prefdefined also.

java.io packages containes classes of stream.

classes for read/input
----------------------

InputStream class
------------------
This is topmost/root class of the inputstream classes hirerachy. it is an abstract class.it has several child classes.few of them are as follows

1)fileInputStream class
2)DataInputStream class
3)objectInputStream class
4)bufferedInputStream class
etc


classes for write/output
-------------------------

OutputStream class
------------------
This is topmost/root class of the outputstream classes hirerachy. it is an abstract class.it has several child classes.few of them are as follows

1)fileOutputStream class
2)DataOutputStream class
3)objectOutputStream class
4)printStream class
etc

System.out.println is a method of printstream class which is also a child class of outputStream class.

import java.io.*;

public class WriteApp 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		try 
		{
			FileOutputStream fos=new FileOutputStream("D:\\java\\weekend\\core_java\\IO\\self\\aa.txt");
			//pass the url of the folder in which you want
			//to write the code
			//now we want to write the code in the file
			//we will create object of printstream
			PrintStream ps=new PrintStream(fos);
			ps.println("Welcome to the CETPA Infotech");
			ps.println("Hello Everyone");
			ps.print("Noida");
			ps.println("This is an Example of IO");
			ps.println("Delhi");
		} 
		catch (Exception ex) 
		{
			System.out.println(ex);
		}
	}

}
output of above programme

input example
--------------

import java.io.*;

import javax.swing.event.TreeWillExpandListener;

public class ReadApp 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		try 
		{
			FileInputStream fis=new FileInputStream("D:\\java\\weekend\\core_java\\IO\\self\\aa.txt");
			//to read the things in the file we will use datainputstream method
			DataInputStream dis=new DataInputStream(fis);
			String str=dis.readLine();//this will return the text in the first line
			//after executing returns null at end
			//hence we will put this in loop
			while(str!=null)
			{
			System.out.println(str);
			str=dis.readLine();
			}
		} 
		catch (Exception ex) 
		{
			System.out.println(ex);
		}
