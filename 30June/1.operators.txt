operators:Generally their are three operators
based on the type of operand.

1.unary operator:Those operations which are performed 
on the single operand are called unary operator.
ex:-
1.increament operator:This operator is used to increase
----------------------
the value of variable by one.

There are two type of increament operator:
a)Pre-increament:(++x) value is first increased then printed
-----------------
it returns the new increased value. 
ex:-
if 
x=10;
++x;
System.out.print(x);

Result:
11                         increased value:11

b)post-increament:(x++)value is first printed then increased.
------------------
it returns the old value of the variable.
ex:-
if 
x=10;
x++;
System.out.print(x);

Result:
10                        increased value:11

2.decrement operator:
---------------------
a)pre decrement:(--x) value is first decreased & new value will be printed
----------------
ex:-
x=10;
--x;
System.out.print(x);

Result:
9                        decreased value:9


b)post decrement:(x--) value is decreased and it returns the old value.
-----------------
ex:-
x=10;
x--;
System.out.print(x);

Result:
10                          decreased value:9

3.Logical not operator:(!)used for inverting a boolean value.
-------------------------- 

Ex:-
x=true;
x=!y;
System.out.print(x);

Result
False.


                           Airthmetic operators
                         -------------------------


these operators are used for basic calculatoin purpose.
basic operators are
+                to add a value
-                to decrease a value    
*                to multiply a value
/                to devide a value and get the quotient
%                to devide a value and get the remainder value.



                            Assignment Operator
                           -----------------------

Assignment operator is used to assign the value from right to left.


operator used (=)

syntax:
variable= value;

compound operator
-------------------

+=  for adding left operand with righ operand and then assigning it to variable on
the left.

-= for subrtacting left operand with righ operand and then assigning it to the
variable on the left.

*= for multiplying left operand with righ operand and then assigning it to the 
variable on the left.

/= for dividing left operand with right operand and then assigning it to variable 
on the left.

%= for assigning modulo of left opernad with righ operand and then assigning it to
variable on the left.


                           Relational Operator
                          ----------------------

== Equal to

!= Not Equal to

<  less than

>   Greater than

>= Greator than or equal to

<= less than or equal to



                            Logical Operator
                           -------------------

these logical operator are also called conditional operator.

a) &&       AND operator   

It returns true when both condition are true.

    A       B       &&
  true    false   false
  false   true    false
  true    true    true
  false   false   false

b)||        OR operator


It returns true if atleast one condition is true.

  A     B      ||
true   true   true
false  true   true
true   false  true
false  false  false


c)^         Xor operator                           

it is optional operator, it returns true when there is a different true or false in condition A & B.

condition A     B          XOR
true         true          False
true         false        true
false        true          true
false         false        false
