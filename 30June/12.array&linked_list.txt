Arrays & Linked List
----------------------
These are the tools that we can use to implement data structure.

The data that we will keep in array is fixed . but in linked list we can keep any number of data that is linked list is resizable.

Array  can not grow or shrink.

Linked list can grow and shrink.

--> Memory allocation of array is static.
--> Memory allocation of linked list is dynamic.

vvI
---
Array has contiguous memory location accessing data from the array is much faster than accessing data from linked list.

use of for each loop
---------------------
public class App
{
	public static void main(String [] args)
	{
		int [] num={10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100};
		for(int x:num)   //syntax of for-each loop
		{
		System.out.println(x);
		}
	}	
}


Q-WAP to display total of even and total of odd.
A-

public class Trial 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int [] num= {1,20,50,33,80,12,345,67,190,1,45,66,120};
		int even=0;
		int odd=0;
		for(int x:num)
		{
			if(x%2==0)
			{
				even++;
			}
			else
			{
				odd++;
			}
		}
		System.out.println("Even="+even);
		System.out.println("Odd="+odd);
	}

}
