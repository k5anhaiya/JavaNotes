static method
-------------
Method should be static when inside method we are not using instance variable or 
non-static variable. class name should be given to call this method.

Non-static method
-------------
Method should be non static when inside method we are using instance variable or 
non-static variable. object refrence  should be given to call this method.


public class square 
{
	private int num;
	public square(int n)
	{
		num=n;
	}
	public void square1()  //this is a non-static method as we are using instance 
                             	//variable inside the method 
	{
		int sq=num*num;
		System.out.println("Square by square1="+sq);
	}
	/*public void square2(int z)*/  // it should be static because we are not using instance variable 
	                            //inside the method
	public static void square2(int z)
	{
		int sq=z*z;
		System.out.println("Square by square2="+sq);
	}
}


main
-----

public class squareApp 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		square obj=new square(25);
		obj.square1();
		/*obj.square2(10); */ //but here unneccessary we are giving refrence of the object for that we are 
		                  //creating the object also.
		square.square2(15);   //static method will be called by classname.directly.
	}
