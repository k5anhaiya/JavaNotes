sealed class was introduced in java 17
---------------------------------------

the concept of sealed class is sealed class can be used were we are restricting the class to be inherited by limited number of elements.

if you are permiting a class in sealed class then those classes must be sealed /Non-sealed/ or final class 



public sealed class TestSealed permits A,B{
    //normal syntax of sealed class is public sealed class className permits A,B
    //where A, B are classes to be permitted.
    //sealed class can permit only those class which are sealed/Non-sealed/final
}

final class A extends TestSealed{

}

sealed class B extends TestSealed permits C{

}

non-sealed class C extends B{

}

example
-------
in case of creating the payment gateway that might be possible that you need to give permission to few class to inherit their comes the use of selaed class.


we will make a class non-sealed when let us suppose class A is sealed class which is permiting class B & class C so as the rule class B,C can be either sealed/Non-sealed/Final class but we want to use class B to be inherited by other class , in this case we will make class B as non-sealed class so that it can be used or implemented by other class also class A that is sealed class will able to permit Class B & C. 

Note : a sealed class can implement and extend also but should be written in the last
sealed class A extends Thread implements clonable permits B,C{

}


Note : an interface can also be sealed interface or non-sealed interface but an interface can not be final

sealed interface X permits Y{

}

sealed interface Y extends X{

}
