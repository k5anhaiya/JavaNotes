use of super
-------------
super is a method as well as a keyword.
super method is used by child class constructor to call the constructor of parent class.

this is responsibility of child class constructor to call parent class constructor.
this is a rule and this rule can not be voilated. that child class constructor will always call his parent class constructor.

child class constructor must have following code to call the constructor of parent class.

super(); //this code will call default constructor of parent class.
or
super(parameter); //this code will call parameterised constructor of                                  //parent class.

example:

public class AA 
{
	public AA()
	{
		System.out.println("calling default constructor of AA");
	}
	public AA(int x)
	{
		System.out.println("calling parameterized constructor of AA");
	}

}

public class BB extends AA 
{
	public BB()
	{
		  super(); //  this is code to call the default constructor of AA
//			super(50); // this is code to call the parameterized constructor of AA
		System.out.println("Constructor of BB");
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		new BB();
	}

}


or to call the parametrized constructor

public class BB extends AA 
{
	public BB()
	{
		  //super();   this is code to call the default constructor of AA
			super(50); // this is code to call the parameterized constructor of AA
		System.out.println("Constructor of BB");
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		new BB();
	}

}
