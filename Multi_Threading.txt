Multi_Threading
----------------
It is one of the way to achieve multitasking. 
Multitasking means performing more than one task simultaneously.
Multitasking programme can invoke/call more than one method at a time.


public class tableTask extends Thread 
{
	private int num;
	public tableTask(int num) 
	{
		this.num = num;
	}
	public void run()
	{
		for(int ctr=1;ctr<=10;ctr++)
		{
			int ta=num*ctr;
			System.out.println(num+"*"+ctr+"="+ta);
		}
	}
}

Main
----

public class App 
{

	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		tableTask task1=new tableTask(38);
		tableTask task2=new tableTask(18);
		tableTask task3=new tableTask(9);
		
		task1.start();
		task2.start();
		task3.start();

	}

}

Multi_Threading
---------------
it is one of the way to achieve Multi tasking.
another way to achieve multi tasking is multi processing.but multi processing is heavy weight and multi threading is low weight.hence multi threading is used to achieve multi tasking.

Multitasking means executing more than one task at the same time.
Mulitasking programme or application can start execution of more than one method at a time.


for this programme creates and start more than one threads.per task(method) one thread.

In Java every thread is represented in the form of object.
we will have to write code to create this object.
This object should be created from Thread class.
This object can also be created from the child of thread class.


Thread
------
it is smallest unit of processing.Each Thread can be treated as small programme.


Runnable Interface
------------------
Following method of this interface must be overridden by multitasking programme.


public void run()


This is the method that will be executed by all started threads.
so we will write multitasking code inside this method.

we can use this as
------------------
//first task
------------
class Task implements Runnable
{
	public void run()
	{
		//write code to perform task.
	}
}


run() method is a method of Task class.


//second task
--------------
//code to create thread
Thread th=new Thread(new Task());
//code to start thread
th.start();



public class Task implements Runnable 
{
	public void run() 
	{
		System.out.println("Run method is called....");
		for(int i=1;i<=50;i++)
		{
			System.out.print(i+",");
		}
		System.out.println();
	}

}
main
-----

public class App
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		Task task=new Task();
		//code to create thread
		Thread th1=new Thread(task);
		Thread th2=new Thread(task);
		Thread th3=new Thread(task);
		//code to starts all thread
		th1.start();
		th2.start();
		th3.start();

	}

}

This is one of the way of to implement Multithreading.


second way
----------
Thread class already implemented Runnable interface.
class Task extends Thread
{
	public void run()
	{
		//write code to perform task
	}
}

Task th=new Task();   //this object will be treated as thread.
th.start()

This is Second way of to implement Multithreading.
