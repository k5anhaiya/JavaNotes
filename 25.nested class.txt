 Nested class
------------
A Class which is defined inside another class is known as nested class.
This class is also known as inner class.

Public class AA
{
	class BB   //non-static nested class
	{
	}
	Static class CC      //static nested class
	{
	}
	void show()
	{
		class DD       //Local nested class
		{
		}
	}
}

The class which is inside the class may be static nested class or non static nested class. the class which is defined inside method are called local nested class.

The class in which nested class will be defined is known as outer class.

here there are 3 nested class named BB CC DD
and 1 outer class AA

---------
Nested class can use properties (Methods,variables,etc) of the outer Class.
