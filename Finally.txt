finally
-------


The finally keyword is used in association with a try/catch block and guarantees that a section of code will be executed, even if an exception is thrown. The finally block will be executed after the try and catch blocks, but before control transfers back to its origin.




// A Java program to demonstrate finally.
class Geek {
	// A method that throws an exception and has finally.
	// This method will be called inside try-catch.
	static void A()
	{
		try {
			System.out.println("inside A");
			throw new RuntimeException("demo");
		}
		finally
		{
			System.out.println("A's finally");
		}
	}

	// This method also calls finally. This method
	// will be called outside try-catch.
	static void B()
	{
		try {
			System.out.println("inside B");
			return;
		}
		finally
		{
			System.out.println("B's finally");
		}
	}

	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		try {
			A();
		}
		catch (Exception e) {
			System.out.println("Exception caught");
		}
		B();
	}
}
