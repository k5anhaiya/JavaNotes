compiler
--------
work of compiler is to compile the source code.
-java compiler is used to compile it.
-java generates executable codes with the help of java compiler.

During compilation following two steps are performed:
1.Parsing: check errors in source code.
2.translation: if source code has no errors then source code is translated to
the machine code by java compiler.
 -but java compiler not convert the java code to machine code it converts the
source code to byte code.this byte code is saved in .class file.
-jvm converts the byte code to the machine code.


.class file:
-------------
This is a class file generated by java compiler during the compilation.in which
java compiler store the byte code which is generated on compilation of the source 
code.

main() method
-------------
Every java programme have main method.
without main method programme can not start execution.
