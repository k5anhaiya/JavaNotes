Encapsulation:
--------------
wrapping up attributes and behaviours(methods) of the object into a single unit is known as encapsulation.
this is achieved by defining a class.

Instance variable inside class should be private.

class loading
-------------
Every class that a program  is using will be loaded by JVM into memory this process is called class loading.
              As we know every class is a file and it contains executable commands so these command should be in memory for execution that's why each class is loaded.

Static block:
------------
we can define this block inside class by using static keyword.This block is executed automatically when class is loaded. so command written inside this block is executed on class loading.

examples:


public class AA 
{
	static
	{
		System.out.println("Class AA is loaded...");
	}
}


public class BB 
{
	static
	{
		System.out.println("Class BB is loaded...");
	}
}
import java.util.Scanner;

public class App 
{

	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
	new AA();
	new BB();
	new Scanner(System.in);
	}

}
